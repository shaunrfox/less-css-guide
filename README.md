# Less CSS Guide

This site is meant to demonstrate properties of Less and CSS.

---

## This site is built on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator.

You may need to install/update: `Ruby`, `bundle`, `less`, `jekyll` 

Once you've cloned the repository, run `bundle install` from the root folder. If you need to update dependencies, this should tell you what to do.

To run Jekyll locally, navigate to the project's folder and run `bundle exec guard`. This will compile your changes and watch for new ones, plus serve your site up at [localhost:4000/less-css-guide/](http://localhost:4000/less-css-guide/).


## How to create a new item in the list

Duplicate a file in the `_posts` folder and rename to the current date and the name of the section you wish to create.

  2016-05-06-dropdowns.markdown

Open the file in your favorite editor and make the same changes in the [front-matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) of your post. You can add tags, which we'll probably use down the road.

  layout: post
  title:  "Dropdowns"
  date:   2016-05-06
  categories: CSS SCSS HTML Javascript

Add content using Markdown. See: [this](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) or [this](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

## Content Types

#### Description

A simple description will help people with context.

#### Code

Code can be shown with Jekyll's built-in syntax highlighter:

  {% highlight html %}
    [insert code here]
  {% endhighlight %}

#### Example

Use an h3 (`### Example`) to make a header for this section.
